# Computer-Vision
In this repository, I have various basic template programs that can use your computer's webcam to emulate different vision techniques.<br/>

**RUNNING A FILE**<br/>
-Make sure you have installed the packages that are required for each of the programs (Look at the imports at the top)<br/>
-Change the camera object to whatever camera you want to use (Default "VideoCapture(0)" is your computer's webcam)<br/>
-Change the resize ratio to determine how big you want the live output to be (Default is 1 which displays a 1280x720 window)
